# Welcome to Microgliome!

Microgliome is a collation of key microglial sequencing datasets into a user-friendly, interactive web-based tool that can be used by anyone in the scientific community to examine gene regulation in microglia across neurodevelopment.

Microgliome is an R Shiny app that integrates R package trackViewer for layered, linear visualizations of multiple sequencing data tracks of interest. Re-processed epigenomics sequencing data and data tracks included in Microgliome can be found here: https://github.com/ciernialab/MicrogliaChIPseq

This work is supported by the Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform (CONP) Scholar Award.
